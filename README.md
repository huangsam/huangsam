### Hi there :wave:

I work as a full-time software engineer.

I use GitHub as a platform to empower developers and for experimenting with the latest tech.

In my spare time:

- :computer: I'm working on open-source projects
- :seedling: I'm learning Machine Learning on Coursera
- :camera: I shoot photos for family and friends
- :drum: I play the drums for fun

### Hi there :wave:

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience. 🧑‍💻

I use GitHub as a platform to empower developers and to experiment with the latest tech. 🚀

In my spare time:

- 💻 I work on open-source projects
- 📷 I shoot photos for family and friends
- 🥁 I play the drums in band settings
- ⌨️ I build custom keyboards
